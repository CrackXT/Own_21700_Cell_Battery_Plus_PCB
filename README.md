# Own_21700_Cell_Battery_Plus_PCB

PCB files for a 21700 cell mount on a separate board with protection circuit and battery fuel gauge.

# Description

Compatible with unprotected 21700 cell type only!

This is an external battery cell board that allows you to mount the appropriate cell holder (21700) and thus have better connection and mounting options in your project or case. This is the "plus" variant with protection circuit and a battery fuel gauge.

The board can be produced here (AISLER) with the files (.brd and .sch) or by any other PCB manufacturer. -> https://aisler.net/
